* Attribution Graphs Explorer

A toolkit for exploring attribution graphs and circuit tracing in transformer models, implemented in Guile Scheme.

** Overview

Attribution Graphs Explorer is a framework for mechanistic interpretability of transformer models based on circuit tracing methods. The toolkit allows researchers to:

- Extract computational circuits from neural networks
- Trace linear paths of information flow
- Visualize attribution graphs
- Test causal hypotheses through perturbation

Our implementation builds on the methods described in the [[https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html][Attribution Graphs]] research, allowing for programmatic analysis of neural network internals.

** Architecture

The toolkit is organized around several key components:

*** Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLT)

Cross-Layer Transcoders provide a way to bypass MLP nonlinearities, creating linear feature-to-feature interactions that can be traced through the network. The CLT modules:

- Read from the residual stream at one layer
- Contribute to all subsequent MLP layers
- Maintain sparse feature representations

*** Attribution Graphs

Attribution graphs represent the computational flow as a directed graph:

- *Nodes*: Features, tokens, and logits
- *Edges*: Attribution weights between features
- *Paths*: Computational circuits through the network

*** Circuit Discovery

The toolkit provides algorithms for finding interpretable circuits:

- Path tracing algorithms
- Circuit motif identification
- Circuit visualization

*** Validation Framework

Test hypotheses about discovered circuits:

- Perturbation experiments
- Causal validation
- Sparsity and concentration metrics

** Getting Started

*** Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/attribution-graphs-explorer.git
cd attribution-graphs-explorer
#+end_src

*** Requirements

- Guile Scheme 2.2+
- SRFI libraries (1, 9, 43)

*** Basic Usage

#+begin_src scheme
;; Load the framework
(add-to-load-path "/path/to/attribution-graphs-explorer")
(use-modules (attribution-graphs clt transcoder)
             (attribution-graphs graph attribution)
             (attribution-graphs circuits discovery))

;; Create a cross-layer transcoder
(define my-clt (make-clt 5 '(6 7 8) 768 128 768))

;; Generate attribution graph
(define graph (compute-attribution-graph my-clt "Example input" 'last-token))

;; Find and visualize circuits
(define circuits (find-circuits graph))
(display (circuit->mermaid circuits graph))
#+end_src

** Examples

The repository includes example applications:

*** Poetry Generation Circuit

Analyzes how transformer models plan rhyming in poetry:

#+begin_src scheme
(use-modules (attribution-graphs examples poetry-circuit))
(analyze-poetry-planning model "Roses are red\nViolets are ")
#+end_src

*** Multi-hop Reasoning Circuit

Traces factual recall with intermediate reasoning steps:

#+begin_src scheme
(use-modules (attribution-graphs examples reasoning-circuit))
(analyze-multihop-reasoning model "The capital of the state containing Dallas is")
#+end_src

** Research Context

This toolkit builds on recent work in mechanistic interpretability of large language models:
