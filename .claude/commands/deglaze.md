Let's deglaze this project in preparation for mise en place:

1. Pull upstream changes and integrate:
   - git pull origin main
   - Fix any merge conflicts
   - git add . && git commit -m "WIP: Deglaze merge"

2. Verify repository metadata:
   - Check description and topics match current state
   - Update if needed (Settings > Details)

3. Ensure alignment across project assets:
   - Documentation reflects current implementation
   - Scripts are executable and tested
   - Makefile targets are current and working
